Nine years ago today we started nonfiction studios inc. out of the ashes of an insolvent previous employer.

Myself, Robb and the team took this day to get the (new) office ready, cutting apart doors to make desks, hooking up computers and servers, and getting ready for the next workday - Monday.

Monday morning we were dressed up in suits, pounding the pavement, talking to all of our customers and re-assuring them that:

1. Their projects would continue on.
2. They would be on time.
3. They would be on budget.

We kept those promises and still have most of those customers from nine years ago.

Thanks to our customers for nine great years.

Thanks to our great staff who have believed in us through thick and thin.

It hasn't been easy, but it's been rewarding, challenging, frustrating and life-changing - we're looking forward to what the next nine years bring!

Robb and Darron

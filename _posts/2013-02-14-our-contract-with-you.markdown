Over the last few years, we've noticed that a lot of our interactions have been with larger companies. Due to their size, often these arrangements are smothered with large amounts of legalese.

We totally agree that clear agreements are paramount to a good working relationship - but often the legal documents we end up with, do nothing to *clear* anything up - it ends up more like *clear as mud*.

For one of our long term clients, we recently created a *client relationship contract* - and we felt that we should post that here, to show what *all* of our clients should expect. No matter who you are, this is our contract with you:

When we work together on a visual design project
------------------------------------------------

Upon final and complete payment of the approved quote, you have a worldwide, royalty free, license to do whatever you want with whatever we’ve done for you. You can re-use, tweak, change, slash, burn, do anything you want - it’s yours.

We will never resell or reuse your unique design.

We will give you any working files upon request within 6 months completion of a project without any fee - longer than that we’ll provide those files when possible and for a nominal fee.

We reserve the right to show what we’ve done for you in our portfolio of work done.

When we work together on a web site, application or intranet project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon final and complete payment of the approved quote, you have a worldwide, royalty free, license to do whatever you want with whatever we’ve done for you.  You can re-use, tweak, change, slash, burn, do anything you want - it’s yours.

We do not give up our Intellectual Property rights to the code we’ve developed for you unless that’s been negotiated beforehand. We use and re-use code from projects as developed - that guarantees we’re able to be competitive and keep improving our delivered work as time progresses. You’re using code we developed for other clients and in some cases they may use yours.

We may also be using third party code to build your site, we have no rights to that code and you’re bound by the provisions in that code as described.

We will never resell or reuse your exact website for any other client than you - and only upon request.

We will give you any working files upon request within 6 months completion of a project without any fee - longer than that we’ll provide those files when possible and for a nominal fee.

We reserve the right to show what we’ve done for you in our portfolio of work done.

When we host your web site or application.
------------------------------------------

Your data is your data - no matter how it is - we merely host it on our server infrastructure for you.

We may need to backup or copy the data from time to time, but we have no rights to it if we didn’t build it.

We make best efforts to keep your sites up and running 100% of the time - the status is always available to view at: 

[http://status.nonfiction.ca/](http://status.nonfiction.ca/)

When we fall short of that goal, we do our best to explain what happened, why it happened and how we're working to make sure it never happens again.

Hopefully this helps to show what you *should* be getting - any thoughts or comments?

As always, if we're falling short - please let us know!

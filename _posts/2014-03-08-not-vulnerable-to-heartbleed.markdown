Yesterday a significant security bug that affects the vast majority of internet infrastructure was widely publicized.

It's called the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) Bug and it's a significant problem for many providers.

nonfiction's production servers are not vulnerable to the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) Bug in any way.

We had an open source project that was potentially vulnerable, but it was configured in such a way as to have no impact. We also have an unreleased SaaS project that was vulnerable, but it used no shared resources and has been fully patched and upgraded.

We are getting updated SSL keys for those items, but their potential vulnerabilities have no impact on the rest of nonfiction's production and client servers.

We are monitoring the situation and making sure that our suppliers and providers are fully patched and any additional systems we're using are not affected.

Please let [us](mailto:darron@nonfiction.ca) know if you've got any questions or concerns.

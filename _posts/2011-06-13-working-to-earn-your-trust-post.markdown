Was thinking about how I interact with car mechanics lately - since I'm due for another oil change. *Most* of the time, I decline their offers for additional services reflexively. This isn't because I know that my vehicle doesn't need the service - it's just because I don't trust their motivations and have been burned in the past. Being burned in the oil change business isn't very expensive, I think the last time I got hooked it was $129 for service I didn't really need. I now second guess everything that those people say - often just long enough to say: *No thanks.*

I don't trust car mechanics because I'm mechanically illiterate. So that makes me skeptical of their suggestions because of the knowledge gap.

How does that apply to this post?

Well, we've been building websites as [nonfiction studios inc.](http://nonfiction.ca) for 8 and a half years now. Many of our clients were with us when we started out of the ashes of another studio. We've kept most of them for this entire time and they've developed a trust in us that we've worked hard to keep.

When we do work with those clients - our long term partners - we are able to do *much* better work for them. We don't have to fight about simple decisions - they trust we have their best in mind. And we trust that they know their business and that we don't - we rely on them for information about their company and clients.

We want to get *all* of our clients into that position - a position where they will trust us - and allow us to do our best work.

I have a large client that we do a ton of work for - from all sorts of departments. Some of those departments trust us - and we do our best work for them. They have a problem, we discuss the problem and then come up with solutions - they give input from their perspective as business experts - and we give input from a design and development perspective. And in the end, we have a great product - delivered on time and on budget with minimal drama and maximum impact.

I have some other departments at that client that don't seem to trust our advice at all. We're constantly second guessed until the project is a barely recognizable shell of what we designed and planned for. We're constantly having to re-do and re-work something that will never deliver - because our advice was consistently ignored - for whatever reason.

It all comes down to trust. We want to earn your trust - so that we can do better work and make you look like a hero.

That's really our only job - to make you look good - so let's work together.

How can we do better to earn your trust?

Due to the recent flooding, nonfiction studios' office is without power and inaccessible.

This does *NOT* affect your project files - we have a current offsite copy.

This does *NOT* affect your website in any way - all of our websites are hosted remotely.

Please bear with us as we re-establish and distribute working files to our team - but we're available to help.

Our email is working just fine - that may be the best way to get ahold of us - [our contact information is available here](http://www.nonfiction.ca/studio/who-we-are.html).

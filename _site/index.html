<h2><a href="http://nonfiction.ca/blog/2013/06/22/were-available-to-help.html">We're available to help.</a></h2>

  <p>Due to the recent flooding, nonfiction studios&#8217; office is without power and inaccessible.</p>

<p>This does <em>NOT</em> affect your project files - we have a current offsite copy.</p>

<p>This does <em>NOT</em> affect your website in any way - all of our websites are hosted remotely.</p>

<p>Please bear with us as we re-establish and distribute working files to our team - but we&#8217;re available to help.</p>

<p>Our email is working just fine - that may be the best way to get ahold of us - <a href='http://www.nonfiction.ca/studio/who-we-are.html'>our contact information is available here</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://nonfiction.ca/blog/2013/03/09/how-we-keep-your-sites-up.html">How we keep your sites up.</a></h2>

  <p>At nonfiction, we work hard to keep your sites up and fast. Take a look at our <a href='http://status.nonfiction.ca'>status page</a> - we&#8217;re doing a pretty good job overall.</p>

<p>To do this we need a good team, smart development practices, stable tools and good partners. If you&#8217;re interested in some of the tools we&#8217;re using to keep your sites running - take a look at a <a href='http://blog.froese.org/2013/03/09/monitoring-logs-metrics-tools/'>recent post on my personal blog</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://nonfiction.ca/blog/2013/02/14/our-contract-with-you.html">Our contract with you.</a></h2>

  <p>Over the last few years, we&#8217;ve noticed that a lot of our interactions have been with larger companies. Due to their size, often these arrangements are smothered with large amounts of legalese.</p>

<p>We totally agree that clear agreements are paramount to a good working relationship - but often the legal documents we end up with, do nothing to <em>clear</em> anything up - it ends up more like <em>clear as mud</em>.</p>

<p>For one of our long term clients, we recently created a <em>client relationship contract</em> - and we felt that we should post that here, to show what <em>all</em> of our clients should expect. No matter who you are, this is our contract with you:</p>

<h2 id='when_we_work_together_on_a_visual_design_project'>When we work together on a visual design project</h2>

<p>Upon final and complete payment of the approved quote, you have a worldwide, royalty free, license to do whatever you want with whatever we’ve done for you. You can re-use, tweak, change, slash, burn, do anything you want - it’s yours.</p>

<p>We will never resell or reuse your unique design.</p>

<p>We will give you any working files upon request within 6 months completion of a project without any fee - longer than that we’ll provide those files when possible and for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to show what we’ve done for you in our portfolio of work done.</p>

<h2 id='when_we_work_together_on_a_web_site_application_or_intranet_project'>When we work together on a web site, application or intranet project.</h2>

<p>Upon final and complete payment of the approved quote, you have a worldwide, royalty free, license to do whatever you want with whatever we’ve done for you. You can re-use, tweak, change, slash, burn, do anything you want - it’s yours.</p>

<p>We do not give up our Intellectual Property rights to the code we’ve developed for you unless that’s been negotiated beforehand. We use and re-use code from projects as developed - that guarantees we’re able to be competitive and keep improving our delivered work as time progresses. You’re using code we developed for other clients and in some cases they may use yours.</p>

<p>We may also be using third party code to build your site, we have no rights to that code and you’re bound by the provisions in that code as described.</p>

<p>We will never resell or reuse your exact website for any other client than you - and only upon request.</p>

<p>We will give you any working files upon request within 6 months completion of a project without any fee - longer than that we’ll provide those files when possible and for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to show what we’ve done for you in our portfolio of work done.</p>

<h2 id='when_we_host_your_web_site_or_application'>When we host your web site or application.</h2>

<p>Your data is your data - no matter how it is - we merely host it on our server infrastructure for you.</p>

<p>We may need to backup or copy the data from time to time, but we have no rights to it if we didn’t build it.</p>

<p>We make best efforts to keep your sites up and running 100% of the time - the status is always available to view at:</p>

<p><a href='http://status.nonfiction.ca/'>http://status.nonfiction.ca/</a></p>

<p>When we fall short of that goal, we do our best to explain what happened, why it happened and how we&#8217;re working to make sure it never happens again.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps to show what you <em>should</em> be getting - any thoughts or comments?</p>

<p>As always, if we&#8217;re falling short - please let us know!</p>

<h2><a href="http://nonfiction.ca/blog/2011/11/16/were-nine-years-old.html">We're Nine!</a></h2>

  <p>Nine years ago today we started nonfiction studios inc. out of the ashes of an insolvent previous employer.</p>

<p>Myself, Robb and the team took this day to get the (new) office ready, cutting apart doors to make desks, hooking up computers and servers, and getting ready for the next workday - Monday.</p>

<p>Monday morning we were dressed up in suits, pounding the pavement, talking to all of our customers and re-assuring them that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Their projects would continue on.</li>

<li>They would be on time.</li>

<li>They would be on budget.</li>
</ol>

<p>We kept those promises and still have most of those customers from nine years ago.</p>

<p>Thanks to our customers for nine great years.</p>

<p>Thanks to our great staff who have believed in us through thick and thin and worked incredibly hard on the work we&#8217;ve been entrusted with.</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t been easy, but it&#8217;s been rewarding, challenging, frustrating and life-changing - we&#8217;re looking forward to what the next nine years bring!</p>

<p>Robb and Darron</p>

<h2><a href="http://nonfiction.ca/blog/2011/07/19/creative-director-art-show.html">Our Creative Director is having an art show.</a></h2>

  <p><img alt='Art.' src='/blog/images/2011/07/19/image2.jpg' /></p>

<p>Our own creative director, Edwin, along with some of his studio mates, are having a show at the EPCOR CENTRE for the Performing Arts. The show runs from July 1st to September 25, with an opening reception on August 4th, at the Ledge Gallery (across from the Max Bell Theatre upstairs).</p>

<p>Take the short stroll through the building in the direction of 9th Ave (past the Baraka Cafe). You will be able to see some specially created artworks for the display windows, as well as some unique Amigurumi (knitted stuff toys). Go find out what an amigurumi is, and amaze your friends with your knowledge of japanese pop culture at the next dinner party!&#8230;</p>

<p><img alt='Art.' src='/blog/images/2011/07/19/image1.jpg' /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the Epcor&#8217;s website:</p>

<p>EPCOR CENTRE for the Performing Arts is thrilled to present Burnt Toast Studio&#8217;s Brad Snyder, Edwin Herrenschmidt, Alden Alfon, Shannon MacKinnon and James Jensen, exhibiting print, design and text, over the summer months in its Window Galleries. These five artists explore screen printing, relief printing, mixed media, papermaking, painting, sculpture and were selected for their artistic quality and appeal to all ages, promoting artistic dialogue within our city.</p>

<p><a href='http://burnttoaststudio.com/'>Burnt Toast Studio</a>, founded in 2000, is a nonprofit independent artist collective in the Highland Park district of North Calgary. The six original members first met in 1993 while studying printmaking at the Alberta College of Art + Design. Burnt Toast Studio strives towards the continuation of an atmosphere in which the members can be part of something larger than themselves.</p>

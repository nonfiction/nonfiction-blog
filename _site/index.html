<h2><a href="http://nonfiction.ca/blog/2011/06/17/working-to-earn-your-trust-post.html">Working to earn your trust.</a></h2>

  <p>Was thinking about how I interact with car mechanics lately - since I&#8217;m due for another oil change. <em>Most</em> of the time, I decline their offers for additional services reflexively. This isn&#8217;t because I know that my vehicle doesn&#8217;t need the service - it&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t trust their motivations and have been burned in the past. Being burned in the oil change business isn&#8217;t very expensive, I think the last time I got hooked it was $129 for service I didn&#8217;t really need. I now second guess everything that those people say - often just long enough to say: <em>No thanks.</em></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t trust car mechanics because I&#8217;m mechanically illiterate. So that makes me skeptical of their suggestions because of the knowledge gap.</p>

<p>How does that apply to this post?</p>

<p>Well, we&#8217;ve been building websites as <a href='http://nonfiction.ca'>nonfiction studios inc.</a> for 8 and a half years now. Many of our clients were with us when we started out of the ashes of another studio. We&#8217;ve kept most of them for this entire time and they&#8217;ve developed a trust in us that we&#8217;ve worked hard to keep.</p>

<p>When we do work with those clients - our long term partners - we are able to do <em>much</em> better work for them. We don&#8217;t have to fight about simple decisions - they trust we have their best in mind. And we trust that they know their business and that we don&#8217;t - we rely on them for information about their company and clients.</p>

<p>We want to get <em>all</em> of our clients into that position - a position where they will trust us - and allow us to do our best work.</p>

<p>I have a large client that we do a ton of work for - from all sorts of departments. Some of those departments trust us - and we do our best work for them. They have a problem, we discuss the problem and then come up with solutions - they give input from their perspective as business experts - and we give input from a design and development perspective. And in the end, we have a great product - delivered on time and on budget with minimal drama and maximum impact.</p>

<p>I have some other departments at that client that don&#8217;t seem to trust our advice at all. We&#8217;re constantly second guessed until the project is a barely recognizable shell of what we designed and planned for. We&#8217;re constantly having to re-do and re-work something that will never deliver - because our advice was consistently ignored - for whatever reason.</p>

<p>It all comes down to trust. We want to earn your trust - so that we can do better work and make you look like a hero.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s really our only job - to make you look good - so let&#8217;s work together.</p>

<p>How can we do better to earn your trust?</p>
